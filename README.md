ShoppingList
============

This is an Android application that has a shopping list. It contains a list that you can add three categories of items. You can create or delete the items, mark if an item is bought. 
It uses basic SQL database to store the items and it has an initial Splash activity and uses SharedPreference for installing the user's name and password. This is the first time I use permanent storage techniques.

Notes: It is a 2-week homework assignment.
